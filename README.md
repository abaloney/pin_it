# Pin It!

A *very* simple chrome extension for quickly pining images from the web to [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com).

## How it works

Just [install](https://github.com/downloads/kastner/pin_it/pinterest.crx) the extension in chrome, right click on any images you like, and select "Pin it!". Fill out the form, and boom!


## Note

You have to be signed in to Pinterest for this to work ;).
